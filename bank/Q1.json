The bank is preparing to launch a major sustainability initiative in response to evolving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulations.\n\nThe bank has a developing Enterprise Architecture practice and has adopted the TOGAF Standard as its architecture framework. The Chief Sustainability Officer, recently appointed to lead the ESG transformation program, is the sponsor of this architecture effort.\n\nAn Enterprise Architecture project has been initiated to define how the bank will achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2030 and integrate ESG metrics into customer-facing products. A Statement of Architecture Work has been approved and the project is in the early stages of Phase A. The Architecture Vision has been drafted with input from the Sustainability Office and the CFO's team.\n\nAt the Architecture Vision review workshop, the Chief Risk Officer raised a fundamental concern: the proposed Architecture Vision assumes the bank's existing risk assessment frameworks can be extended to cover ESG risk, but he believes that sustainability risk modeling requires entirely new analytical capabilities that the current risk systems cannot accommodate. He has indicated that if this assumption proves incorrect, the entire program timeline and budget would need to be reconsidered.",

The Target Architecture has been approved and the team has identified nine major work packages required to migrate from the Baseline to the Target. These work packages span business process redesign, data migration, application development, and infrastructure modernization.\n\nDuring Phase E planning, the Head of Tax Operations raised a fundamental concern: the proposed implementation approach requires significant changes to tax processing workflows while the agency continues to operate \u2014 there is no option to suspend tax collection during the migration. She stated that the agency processes two major tax filing periods annually (personal income tax in April and corporate tax in September) during which system stability is critical. Any implementation activity that disrupts operations during these periods would result in significant revenue loss and public controversy.

Business Scenarios are the TOGAF-prescribed technique for discovering and documenting business requirements when stakeholder needs vary or are not fully understood. By developing scenarios for different operational contexts and customer segments, the architect can identify both the common requirements that span all contexts and the context-specific requirements.

The scenarios provide the structured discovery mechanism to work through the complexity.",

Capability-based planning is a valid TOGAF technique.

The workshop would identify the specific regulatory requirements for autonomous equipment in each country, map the approval process and timelines, and determine the optimal sequencing of deployments based on regulatory readiness. You would use the workshop findings to validate and revise the Transition Architectures so that each reflects achievable implementation states given regulatory constraints. You would document the revised sequencing in the Architecture Roadmap and obtain Architecture Board approval before Phase F."

It identifies the regulatory approvals as critical external dependencies, maps them to work packages and Transition Architectures, and refines the sequencing based on these dependencies. The TOGAF standard explicitly states that dependencies should be used to determine the sequence of implementation and that Transition Architectures must be defined based on dependencies and constraints. This is comprehensive dependency management applied to regulatory constraints \u2014 the prescribed Phase E approach.",

The Implementation Factor catalog is the correct artifact for capturing implementation constraints. However, it treats regulatory approval as a constraint that shapes strategy formulation rather than as a dependency that determines sequencing. Option A's dependency analysis is more precise and directly addresses the sequencing concern.",

However, regulatory approvals are not risks to be mitigated \u2014 they are mandatory dependencies that determine when implementation can occur.
